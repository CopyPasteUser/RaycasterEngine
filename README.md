# Raycaster Engine

**Welcome to my Raycaster Engine project!**

## Introduction

This project is my journey into game development using Java. I'm exploring raycasting techniques to create 3D-like environments in a 2D space.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have JDK installed.
3. Compile and run `RaycasterEngine.java`.

## Features

- **Player Movement:** Use W, A, S, D keys.
- **Angle Visualization:** Line indicates player's direction.
- **Basic Raycasting:** Simulates 3D depth perception.

## Planned Enhancements

- **3D Raycasting:** Support true 3D environments.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Add enemies, obstacles, items.
- **Graphics and Sound:** Enhance visuals and audio.
- **Level Design:** Create engaging levels.

## Learning Goals

- Gain Java game dev skills.
- Understand graphics rendering.
- Learn game design principles.
